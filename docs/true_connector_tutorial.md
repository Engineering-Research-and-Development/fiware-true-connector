This is a step-by-step tutorial that will introduce in detail how to exchange data in a trusted environment using the TRUE Connector

## What is IDS?

The International Data Space (IDS) is a virtual data space leveraging existing standards and technologies, as well as governance models well-accepted in the data economy, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem.
It thereby provides a basis for creating smart-service scenarios and facilitating innovative cross-company businessprocesses, while at the same time guaranteeing data sovereignty for data owners.

-   **ECC**, representing the connector exchanging data
-   **Data app**, it is in charge of processing incoming request and provided the relative responses
-   **Usage control data app**, it will check if who are requesting the data has the grants to use that in a well defined policy
